#### By _**Eric Swotinsky and Jamie Pittak**_

## Description

_This application recreates the classic game Tic Tac Toe in JavaScript. The game can currently be played only with local human opponents (no AI available)._

**Known Issues:**
* Game can still continue after a winner is declared.
* Game does not deliver a "game over" state when no valid moves remain.

## Rules of Gameplay

Each player is assigned a character type: player 1 uses smiley faces, while player 2 uses bomb icons.

Players take alternating turns placing one of their characters on the game board by clicking on any unoccupied square.

Once three characters of the same type have been placed in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), the player who placed those characters is declared the winner.
